"# face-generation" 
This program uses a generative adversarial network to produce images of hand written digits and human faces. This network is composed of two connected convolutional neural networks, the generator and discriminator. The discriminator is trained to determine if an input image is a digit (or human face) or not. The generator takes in a one dimensional numpy array of random (uniformly distributed) pixels and uses the convolutional network to convert it to an 28x28 size image. This image is then used as input into the discriminator. Through back propagation, this network is trained to produce images that look closer to the real images of digits and faces. This program made use of the Tensorflow library to build and train the Convolutional neural network models. This model used the MNIST image data set of hand draw digitsto generate images of digits, and the CelebA celebrity face data set to generate images of human faces. The model was trained using a GPU through Amazon Web Services. It was only run for 1-2 epochs and it produced visibly accurate results.
